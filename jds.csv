Software Engineer,SeatGeek,"The Overview

We're looking for smart, curious engineers who want to help millions of people experience the thrill of live entertainment. The ticketing industry is messy, complex and ultimately makes attending live events more difficult than it should be; we believe a thoughtful application of software can fix that.

SeatGeek is a product-centric organization that deploys code into production multiple times per day. Our application is built in the microservice architectural style and we strive to use the best language for the task at hand. As we grow, the scale of our technical challenges - and their impact on our customers - continues to increase. We want to make sure we continue to build the best product we can.

What We're Looking For
Experience building web applications, especially within a microservices architecture. We'll be most interested in hearing about what you've built
Experience solving complex technical challenges. SeatGeek engineers have had to create custom solutions to rather unique ticketing problems, including venue mapping, inventory tracking, and event matching. We'll be excited to hear about challenging problems you've faced and solved
Confidence with at least one language and comfort with several others
Passion for software craftsmanship and product. You have well-considered opinions about how software should work, and hold yourself and your code to a high standard
Commitment to your teammates. You enjoy working with a diverse group of people with different experiences and take pride in mentoring and learning from others
The Tools We Use

You absolutely do not need experience with all of these, but we thought you might be curious. Tools can be learned, so we care much more about your general engineering skill than knowledge of a particular language.
Languages: Python (our primary language), C#/.NET Core, Go and PHP
Datastores: MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ and Elasticsearch
Server: Nginx, Tornado and flask for Python, all running on AWS
Monitoring: InfluxDB/Grafana, Graylog, DataDog & PagerDuty
Version control: Git
Clientside: we make heavy use of React/Redux on the frontend"

The Medidata Clinical Cloud® connects patients, physicians and life sciences professionals. Companies on the Medidata platform are individually and collaboratively reinventing the way research is done to create smarter, more precise treatments. We know that diverse teams win and are fully committed to selecting leaders and employees that represent the markets in which we operate. We are still led by our Co-founders, Tarek Sherif and Glen de Vries, and have global operations in US, Europe and Asia with over 2000 employees.

Your Mission:

You’ll be part of Architecture Enablement, a new distributed agile team within Medidata’s Technology group. Architecture Enablement works with all of our product teams to accelerate Medidata’s architectural goals and vision. As small, tactical and agile engineering teams, we develop core libraries and embed into other teams to implement adoption of the newest standards, tools and automation. Because we are the engineering extension of Architecture leadership, we advocate and accelerate Architecture vision by being hands-on with all teams and applications – we only succeed if they succeed. The Senior Applications Engineer is responsible for hands-on development of Medidata’s software applications and libraries and advocates for their adoption.

Your Commitments:
Develop and maintain the applications, libraries, and automation that enable teams to adopt and advance our architectural standards
Apply good technical practices such as re-factoring, continuous integration, test automation, source code control and review
Participate in Agile working practices such as daily scrum meetings, sprint planning meetings, reviews and retrospectives
Learn to document libraries in a way that easily sets other teams up for self-guided success
Advocate transparency, and be a force multiplier by demonstrating the “how-to” and contemplating the “what-if” through regular blogs, reveals, and pull requests
Provide technical guidance and support to other engineers
Welcome technical guidance and support from others, willingly receive constructive feedback on how we operate and on the libraries we develop
Channel feedback into our own teams’ retrospectives and scrums. Help make us better
Follow Medidata’s Standard Operating Procedures to ensure all software meets regulatory and company requirements
Collaborate with and accelerate teams that are widely distributed between Medidata’s offices (e.g., Tokyo, London, and New York), adjusting schedule and work-style for best fit (but we're not overly obsessed with synchronous schedules - we most often work asynchronously - and most of this position's work will be within typical working hours - just occasional kickoffs and few but regular Æ team meetings will require a flexible schedule.)
Your Competencies:
Experienced .NET developer (required) able to implement and maintain reusable software libraries and scalable services. Additional experience in other static or dynamic languages welcomed.
Demonstrable experience in troubleshooting and debugging web server platforms, software and code

The key factor in lifelong happiness and satisfaction is maintaining long-term, healthy relationships;
Most importantly, the leading factor in the cognitive, emotional, and social development of children (and the future generation) is marriage (i.e. the emotional connection between the two parents).

Software Engineer,Better,"A Better company

We believe homeownership is valuable. Heres why: Not only has homeownership historically been one of the most reliable ways to build wealth, it also strengthens ties to community and contributes positively to overall well-being. The way the mortgage industry operates today makes it harder and harder for people to consider homeownership -- so we set out to change that. The traditional mortgage process is designed to confuse, riddled with unnecessary fees, takes too much time, and is built on a foundation of misaligned incentive structures. Its time Americans had a Better option.

A Better option is one that puts customers in control of the largest financial transaction of their lives. Its built with best-in-class technology, supported by non-commissioned staff, and offers affordable financing options that meet customers where they are.

Since 2016, weve already funded over $1B in loans, raised $75M in capital, and won the NerdWallet Best Online Mortgage Lender for Customer Service and were just getting started.

Trying to modernize a decades old industry isnt easy, but it is supremely rewarding. Become part of a Better team.

A Better opportunity

Help us hack a thirteen trillion dollar industry by building a product that will allow more people than the status quo to own a home and build wealth rather than rent for life. Our tech team is small, and you will be a big part of defining the technical direction and culture. We encourage proposals for projects off the beaten path, experimentation with different frameworks and libraries, and doing as you see fit to solve problems.

We also offer above-market compensation and equity, as well as full benefits. Part-time remote is great with us, although we are looking for candidate who can spend some significant fraction of your time at our office in Soho, NYC.
