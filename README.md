Social Good Hackathon - Increasing gender and cultural diversity in the workplace

Supporting gender equality in the workplace

Studies show that subtle gender-biased language in job advertisements can deter men and women from applying to certain jobs. Gender gaps are especially prevalent in insurance, business, finance, and tech sectors. This loss of diversity can negatively impact company performance. Weâ€™re here to increase diverse hiring by helping recruiters create gender-neutral job postings and establish inclusivity and diversity in the workplace.
